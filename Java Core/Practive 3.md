## 1. Project 2: Manage contacts
**Write a contact management program with the following functions:**

1. **Add new contact:** Allows users to enter information about a new contact, including full name and phone number.
2. **Contact search:** Allows users to enter names and search for contacts in the phonebook. If found, displays contact information, otherwise not found.
3. **Display all contacts:** Print out the information of all contacts in the phonebook.
4. **Delete contact:** Allows users to enter the name of the contact to delete and delete if found, then notify successfully or not found.

**Request:**

- Use array to store contact information.
- Use `while` loop to create user menus and perform functions.
- Use the `if-else` statement to handle searching, adding, and deleting contacts.
- Create and use functions to increase code reuse and organization.

**Suggest:**

Start by creating an array to store contacts. Each contact can be represented by an object or a two-dimensional array (depending on your convenience).
Use a `while` loop to create a menu and loop until the user chooses to exit.
Write functions like `addContact`, `searchContact`, `displayContacts`, `deleteContact` to perform the corresponding functions.
When building functions, remember to check and properly handle necessary conditions and messages.
