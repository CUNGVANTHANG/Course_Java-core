## 1. Check the Armstrong number
Develop a program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is of degree 3 if the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to itself. For example 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.

- Receive integers from the keyboard.
- Calculate the sum of the digits of the number just received, if the sum is equal to that number, print Armstrong Number, otherwise print Not an Armstrong Number

Input

> 187

Output

> Not an Armstrong Number

## 2. Find the greatest multiple of a number
Develop a program to find the greatest multiple of a number under 100

- Receive integers from the keyboard
- Create a loop from 100 to 1, checking if it is divisible by the integer just entered. If correct, print it to the screen and stop looping.

Input

> 9

Output

> 99

## 3. Check Harshad number
Develop a program to check whether a number is a Harshad number or not. A Harshad number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits. For example, 21 is divisible by 3 (= 2 + 1).

- Receive integers from the keyboard
- Create a while loop to get its digits, calculate the sum of the digits.
- Check if the number is divisible by the sum of its digits. If so, print Harshad Number, otherwise print Not a Harshad Number.

Input

> 21

Output

> Harshad Number

## 4. Check for redundancy
Develop a program to check whether a number is redundant or not. A remainder is a number whose sum of divisors is greater than itself. For example, the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Their sum is 16 > 12, so 12 is a surplus.

- Receive integer number from keyboard
- Initialize the variable sum with 0. Create a loop to find factors of number and add to sum
- Check if sum is greater than number, if true, print Abundant Number, otherwise print Not an Abundant Number.

Input

> 12

Output

> Abundant Number

## 5. Self-made computer
Develop a program to create a computer using a switch case

- Receives two real numbers first and second, a string op
- The input string only accepts the values ​​"+", "-", "*" or "/". Based on these values ​​to calculate the corresponding calculation. If there are no above values, print Invalid Operator

Input

> `+`

> 6

> 2

Output

> 8.0
