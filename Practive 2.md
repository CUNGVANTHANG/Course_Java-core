# 1. Check the Palindrome number
Develop a program to check whether a number is a Palindrome number or not. Palindrome number is a number whose reverse is itself. For example 1001, 434,â€¦

Input

> 1001

Output

> Palindrome Number

# 2. Least common multiple of two numbers
Develop a program to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which is the smallest number divisible by both numbers.

Input

> 72

> 120

Output

> 360

# 3. Write a program to find the first n Fibonacci numbers in java. The positive integer n is entered from the keyboard.
Rules of the Fibonacci number sequence: the next number is equal to the sum of the previous 2 numbers, the first 2 numbers of the sequence are 0, 1. For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, .. (f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2))

Input 

> 10

Output

> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

# 4. Arrange the elements in the array from smallest to largest
For example, we have an array of values: 0, 9, 6, 1, 3 that need to be sorted into 0, 1, 3, 6, 9. Write a java program to do this.

Input 
> Enter number of elements in the array n = 

> 5

> Enter elements in the array:

> 0

> 9

> 6

> 1

> 3

Output

> 0, 1, 3, 6, 9

# 5. Insert elements into the array at the specified position
For example, we have an array of values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, we want to insert element 5 into the 2nd position (from position 0 up), we get 0, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4. Let's write a java program that does this

Input 

> Enter number of elements in the array n = 

> 5

> 0

> 1

> 2

> 3

> 4

> Enter the element you want to insert:

> 5

> Enter the location you want to insert:

> 2

Output

> 0, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4
